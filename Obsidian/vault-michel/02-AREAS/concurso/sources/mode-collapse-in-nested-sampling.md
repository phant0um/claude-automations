## Tese central
Nested Sampling is a Monte Carlo algorithm enabling posterior estimation and Bayesian model comparison, and is especially robust in multi-modal posteriors. This is because nested sampling maintains a population of live points sampled from the entire prior. In each iteration, the population is advanced above a likelihood threshold, potentially discarding modes ruled out by the data.

### 1 Introduction
In the physical sciences, Skilling’s nested sampling \[Skilling2004, skilling2006nested\] is a popular Monte Carlo algorithm to achieve Bayesian model comparison and posterior inference. It is especially robust in multi-modal posteriors \[Buchner2023\], and this paper shows additional evidence of this.
Nested sampling maintains a population of $K$ live points sampled from the prior. In each iteration, the point with the lowest likelihood is discarded, and replaced by a new prior sample above that likelihood threshold (likelihood-restricted prior sampling, LRPS). Thus, in each iteration, prior volume where the likelihood is below this threshold becomes inaccessable. The fraction of the prior probability mass excluded can be statistically estimated from order statistics. These replaced points across iterations allow estimation of the evidence and posterior probability distribution \[see, e.g. Ashton2022, for a pedagogical introduction\]. The estimation is based on a one-dimensional integral approximated by a weight sum of the volume restrictions at each iteration times the likelihood of the replaced point. This work focuses on the faithfulness of likelihood-restricted prior sampling in multi-modal settings.
In high-dimensional settings, the replacement is achieved by running a Markov chain started from a randomly chosen live point \[see Buchner2023, for a review of variations\]. We focus here on such algorithms that generate new samples by starting a proposal from a randomly selected live point. This class includes step samplers based on hit-and-run or slice sampling, and some region-based algorithms such as MLFriends \[Buchner2016, Buchner2019c\]. In multi-modal states, the discarded point is removed from one mode, and a replacement point is generated in a mode sampled proportional to the live point occupancy. It is unlikely that the Markov chain succeeds to traverse the disconnected modes.

### 2 Method
We analyse the probability of unintentional mode die-out. We being by making a number of assumptions, followed by introducing a simple two-mode state model, that is probabilistically updated in each nested sampling iteration. We then study the behaviour of this modelling of the nested sampling process.

### 2.1 Assumptions
Firstly, we assume that there are two modes (0 and 1), with fractional constrained prior mass $p\in(0,1)$ and $1-p$, respectively, at the likelihood level under consideration. The modes are populated by $K$ live points in total. The analysis presented here is for two modes; extension to more modes is left for future work. Secondly, we assume the probability ratio $p/(1-p)$ remains approximately fixed over the nested sampling iterations of interest; this is a local approximation valid at any fixed likelihood level and is relaxed in the Discussion. Thirdly, we assume the likelihood-restricted prior sampler (LRPS) is faithful, i.e., new points are drawn proportional to the remaining constrained prior mass in each mode. Fourthly, we assume mode rediscovery is negligible, i.e., once all live points leave a mode, they do not return.
For our analysis, we define mode collapse as a loss of either mode merely due to the random replacement sampling. Our analysis is independent of sampling dimension.

### 2.2 State model and initialisation
Our model tracks the number of live points $i$ that are members of the first mode (and $K-i$ are in the second mode). At a given likelihood level, there are $K+1$ possible states, ranging from $i=0$ to $i=K$ live points in mode 1 (and the remainder in mode 0). The initial state probabilities follow a binomial distribution:
$$
\mathbb{P}(X_{0}=i)=\binom{K}{i}p^{i}(1-p)^{K-i},\quad i=0,1,\dots,K.

### 2.3 Selecting a live point for removal
In each nested sampling iteration, the lowest-likelihood live point is removed and a replacement point is generated above the threshold. We thus need to consider the probability that the removed point (the lowest-likelihood live point) belongs to one mode or the other. Naively, one may expect this to be proportional to the prior volume of the mode it belongs so, but the probability of being selected for removal depends on the evolution of the likelihood threshold.
The mode with a shallower likelihood gradient near the current threshold loses points preferentially, because its live points tend to be spread across lower likelihood values. Such a mode is at genuine risk of die-out, but this is not a failure of nested sampling. It may simply be a less favoured mode being correctly eliminated by the data.
The scientifically important failure mode is the accidental loss of a mode that *should* be retained: one whose live points are concentrated above the threshold, i.e., whose likelihood rises steeply. For such a mode, the probability of being selected as the lowest-likelihood point is *lower* than its fractional occupancy $i/K$ would suggest. The replacement step, however, is unaffected by likelihood gradients: the seed is drawn uniformly from all $K$ live points, so the probability that the replacement point is assigned to mode 1 remains $i/K$ regardless of gradient. Together, the net probability that mode 1 (the steep-gradient mode) loses a point per iteration is *less* than under the symmetric model, because it is less likely to supply the removed point while equally likely to supply the replacement seed. Using $i/K$ as the removal probability therefore *overestimates* how often this mode loses a point on net, giving a conservative (upper-bound) estimate of its die-out risk.

### 2.4 Update
In the LRPS algorithms we consider, the replacement point’s mode is inherited from the seed live point (the seed of the Markov chain). In the implementation class considered here, the dead point remains eligible to serve as the seed, since it still lies on the current likelihood contour and can validly seed a proposal into the constrained region. The seed is therefore drawn uniformly from the full pre-update population of K live points. Under the equal-gradient assumption of Section 2.1, and conservatively for the steeper-gradient mode, the probability that the removed point belongs to mode 1 is $i/K$. The probability that the replacement point is assigned to mode 1 — determined by the mode of the randomly chosen seed — is also $i/K$, since the seed is drawn uniformly from the current $K$ live points. These two draws are independent (both sampled from the pre-update population of $K$ points), so the number of live points in mode 1 changes by $+1$, $-1$, or $0$ with probabilities:
$$
\displaystyle\mathbb{P}(X_{t+1}=i+1\mid X_{t}=i)

### 2.5 Numerical evaluation
Starting from the initial probability vector given by Eq. 1, we multiply by the transition matrix defined by Eqs. 2–4 repeatedly ($t$ times) to obtain the probability distribution of each possible state at iteration $t$. This power of matrices of size $(K+1,K+1)$ is cheap to compute for moderate $K$.

### 2.6 Collapse probability
We define the probability of mode collapse at iteration $t$ as:
$$
\mathbb{P}_{c}(t)=\mathbb{P}(X_{t}=0)+\mathbb{P}(X_{t}=K).

### 2.7 Connection to the neutral Moran process
Our model is analogous to the neutral Moran process in population genetics \[moran1958random\]. A population of $K$ individuals carries a gene that exists in two allelic states. In each generation, one individual is chosen uniformly at random to die, and one individual (possibly the same) is chosen uniformly at random to reproduce, keeping the population size fixed at $K$. In the neutral case, allelic state does not affect fitness. A newly introduced allele will either go extinct or reach fixation (spread to all $K$ individuals), with the fixation probability from state $i$ equal to $i/K$ \[moran1958random\].
The mean time to absorption (fixation or extinction) from state $i$ is \[moran1958random, Watterson1961\]:
$$

### 3 Results
Figure 1: Probability of evolved mode collapse ℙ evol ( t ) \\mathbb{P}\_{\\mathrm{evol}}(t) (Eq. 7 ) as a function of iteration number. The x-axis is normalised by K 2 × min ⁡ p, 1 − K^{2}\\times\\min(p,1-p), for = 0.5 p=0.5 (dotted curves), 0.05 p=0.05 (dashed curves), and 0.01 p=0.01 (solid curves). The y-axis is the conditional collapse probability given that both modes were populated at initialisation. All curves have a sigmoid functional form. The 50% collapse probability is reached between 1 and 3 on the normalised x-axis across all tested values of and, a factor-of-three spread in location.
Figure 1 shows the probability of mode collapse as a function of the number of nested sampling iterations, for several scenarios. This result is obtained through numerical evaluation (Section 2.5). We find that plotting against $\log$ iteration yields an approximately sigmoidal rise as a function of $\log$ iteration, as presented in Figure 1. These results are obtained from sequences of iterations for three values of $p$ (0.5, 0.05, 0.01) and four values of $K$ (40, 100, 400, 1000). Across $p$ and $K$, curves are well-aligned when the x-axis is normalised by $K^{2}\times\min(p,1-p)$; we note that this scaling is empirically observed from the numerical results rather than analytically derived. There is some variation in slope, but a general trend is clear: the probability of evolved mode collapse remains below 50% when $\mathrm{iteration}\lesssim K^{2}\times\min(p,1-p)$. Normalising by the mean absorption time $k(p,K)$ (Eq. 9) instead gives more diverse intercepts and is a less useful scaling.
We can identify the total number of nested sampling iterations from prior to posterior as approximately $K\times H$ \[skilling2006nested\], where $H$ is the information gained in updating from prior to posterior (in nats), equal to the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the posterior from the prior. Setting the iteration budget $KH\lesssim K^{2}\times\min(p,1-p)$ and solving gives a heuristic rule of thumb for the minimum number of live points:

### 4 Discussion
In this paper, we considered how the size of the live point population impacts retention of modes in nested sampling. It is intuitive that with few live points, random replacement creates the risk of mode die-out after a number of iterations. Our result is quite general. While based on numerically evaluated matrix multiplications, our results are based on an analytic framework that is independent of dimensionality and the point replacement algorithm, assuming lost modes cannot be rediscovered.
Our main result (Eq. 10) provides a heuristic scaling law for the minimum number of live points that makes mode die-out unlikely: the number of live points should be set to at least the KL divergence of the posterior from the prior (in nats) divided by the fractional constrained prior mass of the smallest mode at the relevant likelihood levels. With a typical information gain of $H\sim 10$ – $1000\,\mathrm{nats}$ as discussed in \[skilling2006nested\], and a fiducial smallest-mode fractional constrained prior mass of $p=0.1$, Eq. 10 gives a recommendation of order $100$ – $10000$ live points. Assuming that multi-modality is relevant for only a fraction of the $KH$ iterations (e.g., 5%), the effective requirement is reduced by that factor, bringing the estimate to order $10$ – $500$ live points. This is consistent with typically used values in the literature, and suggests that accidental mode die-out is exceedingly rare under commonly used configurations. After an initial nested sampling run, eq. 10 can estimate the probability of unintentional mode die-out.
The number of live points is one of the most fundamental parameters in nested sampling, setting the sampling resolution and thus the probability of discovering a mode (section 2.2), and the number of nested sampling iterations for a given information gain \[Skilling2004, evans2007discussion, Chopin2010\]. Aside from the theoretical cost of evidence accumulation, the practical proposal construction and its efficiency are also relevant. Counterintuitively, \[Buchner2023\] discussed that in many practical nested sampling algorithms, increasing the number of live points increases sampling efficiency, because the proposal built from the $K$ live points becomes more refined with increased $K$, improving acceptance probability.
